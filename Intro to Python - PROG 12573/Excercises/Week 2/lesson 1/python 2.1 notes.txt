python 2.1

when breaking a statement there are two ways, implicit and explicit continuation.
implicit continuation - if contained in a parenthasis it can be broken anywhere 
eg.
print('this',
	'is',
	'totally',
	'valid') 
print ('this
	is
	not')
explicit continuation - use a \ character to break the line

eg.
result = var1 * 2 + var2 *3 + \
	 var3*4 + var4 * 5

Comments above line or inline at the end of a statement using a #

triple quote for multiline strings

declarations follow syntax:

age = 25
no semicolon no type declaration

variables can change type on the fly because the data is rewritten to another address

no real constants in python denote them by using all caps

eg 

TAXRATE = .15
