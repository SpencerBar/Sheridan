1. Go back into your MyRectangle class

Change the output of your program so that, instead of just showing the area as a number like 60, your program will output a more user-friendly output such as:

The area of the rectangle with a width of 30 cm and a height of 2 cm is 60 square cm.


HINT 1 - Remember Strings and Contactenation
HINT 2 - Try to never do calculations inside your print statement.  Use a well-named String variable and output that.
