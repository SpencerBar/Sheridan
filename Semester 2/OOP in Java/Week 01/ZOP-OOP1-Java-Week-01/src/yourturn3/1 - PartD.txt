We would like a program that can figure out the area of a triangle. Write this program for us!








HINT 1 - the formula for area of a triangle is .5 *base * height   (did you ever wonder why this is?  Think about it, if we did base * height, that would give us the area of a rectangle.  But a triangle is just a half a rectangle.  If you smush two of the same trianbles together, they make a rectangle so it makes sense that the area of one of the rectangles would be half of the area of the rectangle - neat eh?)
HINT 2 - don't forget to output your answer in a pleasant fashion!
