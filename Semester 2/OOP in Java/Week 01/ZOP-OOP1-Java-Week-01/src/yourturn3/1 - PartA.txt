1.  Create a class called MyRectangle
public class MyRectangle{
    public static void main(){
        int length = 5;
        int width = 6;

        int areaOfRectangle = length * width
        
    }
}
2.  Build your main method

3.  Declare two int variables named length and width and assign the value 5 to length and 6 to width

4.  Now, declare a variable of type int called areaOfRectangle and make it equal to the length times the width.  In java, we use * to indicate mulitplication

5.  Finally, print out the area for our rectangle which should be 30.

6.  Change the values assigned to length and width.  If you've written your program correctly, you should always get the correct area of the rectangle!



HINT 1 - Remember that we let the variables do the work for us.  Once we've assigned a value to a variable, we can just use the variable name whenever we want to use that value.
