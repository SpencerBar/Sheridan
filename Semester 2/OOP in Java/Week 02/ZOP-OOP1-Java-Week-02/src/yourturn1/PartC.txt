1. Write a program with a single class called Apples
    a. Don’t copy and paste from other code! 
    b. You have 680 apples. 
    c. Each full basket can contain 50 apples. 
    d. Determine how many full baskets of apples that we can fill. 
    e. Use good variable names! 
    f. Output the result in a pleasant fashion using a String. 
 
 
    Hint #1:  We only care about full baskets...we don’t care about any fractions 
    Hint #2:  I find that using smaller numbers sometimes help me to think.  What if there were 5 apples and each basket could only hold 2 apples?  Great, you did that in your head.  Now, what did you do to come up with the answer?

 2. For the extra smarty-pants...also output how many apples are left over.   


    Hint#1: Do you remember modulus from math class?  Modulus tells us how many are left over after dividing.  In java, we use % to indicate modulus.  For example:  3%5  is 2 |||  3%6 is 0  ||| 3%7 is 1
