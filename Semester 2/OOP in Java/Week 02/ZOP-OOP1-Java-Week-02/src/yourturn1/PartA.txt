Write a program with a single class called Year.  

    a.  That will use appropriate variables to determine how many seconds there are in a year and output your answer in a user friendly way.  


 HINTS: 

Hint#1:  How many days in a year?  How many hours in a day?  How many minutes in a hour?  How many seconds in a minute???  Don't forget to use variables to store everything.  Don't just hard-code numbers into your solution.
