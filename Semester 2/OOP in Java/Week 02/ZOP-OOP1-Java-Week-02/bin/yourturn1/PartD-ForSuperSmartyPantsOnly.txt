Write a program with a single class called HowLong.

- The average distance from the earth to the sun is 150 million km. 
- The speed of light is 299,792,458  meters per second. 

Write a program to calculate how many minutes it takes for light to travel from the sun to the 
earth. 
a. Use descriptive names for the Class and the variables.  (Well named variables will make your code 
much easier to understand!)

HINT #1:  If your answer is less than 4 minutes or greater than 10, youâ€™ve done something wrong!  
HINT #2:  Remember that you will be dealing with decimals here - what variable type should you choose?
HINT #2:  Remember that all units must match.  Try converting everything to km 
HINT #3:  There are 1000 meters in a kilometer
